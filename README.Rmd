### 1. Coppell ISD is Texas's First Asian-Majority School District

In a striking demographic shift, **Coppell ISD** became Texas's first Asian-majority public school district, with **56.7%** of students identifying as Asian in 2024. Nearby **Frisco ISD** is close behind at 42.6% -- up from 33.6% in just three years.

```r
# Districts with highest Asian percentage
asian_top <- enr %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "asian", grade_level == "TOTAL", end_year == 2024) %>%
  inner_join(
    enr %>% filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
                   grade_level == "TOTAL", end_year == 2024) %>%
      select(district_id, total = n_students),
    by = "district_id"
  ) %>%
  filter(total >= 10000) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct)) %>%
  select(district_name, total, n_students, pct) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 1)) %>%
  head(10)

stopifnot(nrow(asian_top) > 0)
print(asian_top)
```

```

### 2. One in Four Students is Now an English Learner

The proportion of **Limited English Proficient (LEP)** students grew by 4.1 percentage points in just five years -- from 20.3% to 24.4% of all students. This is the single largest demographic shift in the data.

```r
lep_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "lep", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students, pct) %>%
  mutate(pct_display = round(pct * 100, 1))

stopifnot(nrow(lep_trend) > 0)
print(lep_trend %>% select(end_year, n_students, pct_display))
```

```
#>   end_year n_students pct_display
#> 1     2020    1112674        20.3
#> 2     2021    1108207        20.7

### 3. IDEA Public Schools Grew 55% in Five Years

**IDEA Public Schools**, a charter network operating across Texas, grew from 49,480 to 76,819 students between 2020 and 2024 -- a gain of **27,339 students** (+55.3%). It is the fastest-growing large school system in the state.

```r
# Use district_id join to include 2020 (which has NA district_name)
idea_trend <- losses %>%
  filter(grepl("IDEA", district_name))

stopifnot(nrow(idea_trend) > 0)
print(idea_trend %>% select(district_name, n_2020, n_2024, change, pct_change))

# Year-by-year for 2021-2024 (name filter works for these years)
idea_yearly <- enr %>%
  filter(district_name == "IDEA PUBLIC SCHOOLS", is_district,
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students) %>%

## Quick Start

### R

```{r quickstart-enr, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("almartin82/txschooldata")

library(txschooldata)
library(dplyr)

# Fetch 2024 enrollment data (2023-24 school year)
enr <- fetch_enr(2024)

# Statewide total enrollment
enr |>
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  select(n_students)
#> 5,517,464 students
```

### Python

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/almartin82/txschooldata.git#subdirectory=pytxschooldata

from pytxschooldata import fetch_enr

enr = fetch_enr(2024)
print(enr.head())

## Data Notes

- **Source:** [Texas Education Agency](https://tea.texas.gov/) via AEIS CGI (1997-2002), AEIS SAS (2003-2012), and TAPR (2013-2025)
- **IDs:** District IDs are 6 digits (e.g., `101912` for Houston ISD). Campus IDs are 9 digits (district + 3-digit campus number).
- **Tidy format:** By default, `fetch_enr()` returns long/tidy data with `subgroup`, `grade_level`, and `n_students` columns. Use `tidy = FALSE` for wide format.
- **Percentages:** The `pct` column is a proportion (0-1), not a percentage. Multiply by 100 for display.
- **Caching:** Data is cached locally after first download. Use `use_cache = FALSE` to force refresh.
- **Suppression:** TEA applies data masking to protect student privacy for small subgroups.
- **Asian/Pacific Islander:** Pre-2011 data combines Asian and Pacific Islander into a single "asian" category.
- **Two or More Races:** Only available from 2011 onward (federal reporting change).
- **2020 data quirk:** TEA data for the 2019-20 school year has NA district names; use `district_id` for joins.

### 4. COVID Erased a Decade of Growth in One Year

The pandemic caused the largest single-year enrollment drop in Texas history. Between 2020 and 2021, Texas public schools lost **120,133 students** -- equivalent to the entire enrollment of El Paso ISD, the 7th largest district in the state.

```r
state_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students) %>%
  arrange(end_year) %>%
  mutate(
    change = n_students - lag(n_students),
    pct_change = round(change / lag(n_students) * 100, 2)
  )

stopifnot(nrow(state_trend) > 0)
print(state_trend)
```

```

### 5. Fort Worth ISD Lost 14% of Its Students

While statewide enrollment recovered after COVID, urban districts continue to hemorrhage students. **Fort Worth ISD** lost **11,801 students** (-14.3%), making it the fastest-declining large district in Texas.

```r
# Calculate 2020-2024 changes using district_id (2020 data has NA names)
d2020 <- enr %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level == "TOTAL", end_year == 2020) %>%

         grade_level == "TOTAL", end_year == 2024) %>%
  select(district_id, district_name, n_2024 = n_students)

losses <- d2020 %>%

  mutate(
    change = n_2024 - n_2020,
    pct_change = round((change / n_2020) * 100, 1)
  )

# Largest percentage losses among big districts

### 6. Fort Bend ISD: A District With No Majority

**Fort Bend ISD** is one of the most diverse school districts in America. No racial group exceeds 28% of enrollment -- White (13.2%), Black (27.8%), Hispanic (26.7%), and Asian (27.6%) students are nearly equally represented.

```r
fb_demo <- enr %>%
  filter(district_name == "FORT BEND ISD", is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian")) %>%
  select(end_year, subgroup, pct) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 1)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = subgroup, values_from = pct)

### 7. Kindergarten Enrollment Dropped 5.8%

**Kindergarten enrollment fell from 383,585 to 361,329** -- a drop of 22,256 students (-5.8%). This could signal declining birth rates, rising private school enrollment, or families delaying school entry.

```r
grade_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("PK", "K", "01", "05", "09", "12")) %>%

  pivot_wider(names_from = end_year, values_from = n_students) %>%
  mutate(
    change = `2024` - `2020`,
    pct_change = round(change / `2020` * 100, 1)
  )

### 8. 62% of Students Are Economically Disadvantaged

The share of **economically disadvantaged** students grew from 60.3% to 62.3% -- nearly two-thirds of all students in Texas public schools.

```r
econ_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "econ_disadv", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students, pct) %>%

### 9. White Students Dropped Below 25%

**White enrollment** declined from 27.0% to 25.0% of total enrollment -- a 2 percentage point drop in just five years. Meanwhile, Hispanic (53.2%) and Asian (5.4%) shares continue to grow.

```r
demo_shift <- enr %>%

### 10. 439 Districts Now Have Hispanic Majorities

The number of districts where Hispanic students are the majority grew from 419 in 2020 to **439 in 2024** -- now 36.4% of all Texas districts.

```r
hisp_majority <- enr %>%

### 11. Houston ISD vs Dallas ISD: Two Giants, Two Trajectories

Houston ISD and Dallas ISD are the two largest traditional districts in Texas. Both lost students since 2020, but Houston's losses are nearly double Dallas's in absolute terms.

```r
# Use district_id to include 2020 (which has NA district_name)

### 12. Nearly 1 in 7 Students Receives Special Education

In 2024, **764,858 students** -- 13.9% of all Texas public school students -- receive special education services. That means roughly 1 in 7 students has an identified disability requiring specialized support.

```r
sped_2024 <- enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "special_ed", grade_level == "TOTAL", end_year == 2024) %>%
  select(end_year, n_students, pct) %>%
  mutate(pct_display = round(pct * 100, 1))

stopifnot(nrow(sped_2024) > 0)
print(sped_2024 %>% select(end_year, n_students, pct_display))
```

```
#>   end_year n_students pct_display
#> 1     2024     764858        13.9

### 13. Suburban Boomtowns Are Reshaping Texas Education

While urban districts lose students, fast-growing suburban districts are booming. **Hallsville ISD** nearly doubled (+85.7%), **Prosper ISD** grew 69.1%, and **Frisco ISD** added 3,980 students (+6.4%) between 2020 and 2024.

```r
# Top growing large districts (using district_id join for accurate 2020-2024 comparison)
suburban_growth <- losses %>%
  filter(n_2020 >= 5000) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_change)) %>%
  select(district_name, n_2020, n_2024, change, pct_change) %>%
  head(10)

stopifnot(nrow(suburban_growth) > 0)
print(suburban_growth)
```

```
#>                  district_name n_2020 n_2024 change pct_change

### 14. Pre-K Enrollment Still Hasn't Recovered from COVID

Pre-K enrollment cratered by **21%** during COVID (from 248,413 to 196,560). By 2024 it has clawed back to 247,979 -- still **434 students short** of pre-pandemic levels.

```r
pk_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "PK") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students) %>%
  arrange(end_year) %>%
  mutate(
    change = n_students - lag(n_students),
    pct_change = round(change / lag(n_students) * 100, 1),
    vs_2020 = n_students - first(n_students)
  )

stopifnot(nrow(pk_trend) > 0)
print(pk_trend)
```

```
#>   end_year n_students change pct_change vs_2020
#> 1     2020     248413     NA         NA       0

### 15. Multiracial Students Are the Fastest-Growing Demographic

Students identifying as **Two or More Races** grew from 2.5% to 3.1% of enrollment between 2020 and 2024 -- a 25% increase in raw numbers (138,434 to 173,425). While still a small share, this is the fastest percentage growth of any demographic group.

```r
multi_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "multiracial", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students, pct) %>%
  mutate(pct_display = round(pct * 100, 1))

stopifnot(nrow(multi_trend) > 0)
print(multi_trend %>% select(end_year, n_students, pct_display))
```

```
#>   end_year n_students pct_display
#> 1     2020     138434         2.5
#> 2     2021     143368         2.7
#> 3     2022     155887         2.9
#> 4     2023     166128         3.0
#> 5     2024     173425         3.1
