\dontrun{
# Get school directory data
dir_data <- fetch_directory()

# Get raw format (original TEA column names)
dir_raw <- fetch_directory(tidy = FALSE)

# Force fresh download (ignore cache)

# Filter to active schools only
library(dplyr)
active_schools <- dir_data |>
  filter(status == "Active")

# Find all schools in a district
